**Abstract**

> ##### The missing people relatives in Mexico have demanded the slowness with which a court prosecution file is created. Although the search is immediate, the legal criterion establishes waiting 72 hours to build the prosecution file. This criterion has been copied from the UK and Australian policing reports, but without any adaptation to the Mexican context. The analysis of reports of disappearance between 2006 and 2018 shows that applying the 72-hour criterion is not supported. The analyzed CENAPI database argues that in 72 hours range, only 34.53% of the people had been located with life or lifeless; figure far from 55 to 80% from Europe or Australia. This fact shows that law enforcement personnel, search officers, or officialdom, can be a factor that limits the search for missing people, and also, it is a call to create evidence-based protocols. Furthermore, there is a random pattern in the geospatial distribution of disappearance, with non-homogeneous frequencies per year. Therefore, emphasis is placed on the local analysis of the disappearance patterns for a better characterization. Results highlight the participation of families, the adoption of an evidence-based model, and the generation of geospatial forensic intelligence analysis to generate evidence-based public policies. The phrase "Without the families, no" takes relevance in forensic practice in Mexico and the disappearance data supports this assertion.
